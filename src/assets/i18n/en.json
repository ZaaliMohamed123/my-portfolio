My first love is diving into numbers to find meaning, build models that predict the future, and understand the \"why.\" But what good is a story if it's not well told? That's where my passion for Full Stack Development comes in. I absolutely love turning complex insights into beautiful, intuitive, and useful applications that people can actually use. To me, coding is a creative outlet: it's about building bridges between the pure logic of AI and the human experience."
